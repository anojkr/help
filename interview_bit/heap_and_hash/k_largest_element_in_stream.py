An Efficient Solution is to use Min Heap of size k to store k largest elements of stream. The k’th largest element is always at root and can be found in O(1) time.
How to process a new element of stream?
Compare the new element with root of heap. If new element is smaller, then ignore it. Otherwise replace root with new element and call heapify for the root of modified heap. Time complexity of finding the k’th largest element is O(Logk).
